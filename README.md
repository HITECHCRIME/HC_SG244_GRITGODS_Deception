## Lyrics

```
[killlxv]

I don't know you
Anymore you're
Just a scar
All i have is pain
You see me fall apart

You would
Stab my back
Deception
Is all you've known

Taking 
All i had
Intentions
Were unknown



 

[mothnode]
all those who were close
all of them lot
still thought they cared for me 
but there was only doubt
never give into fear 
all i truly cared for 
was foolish sobriety of the lost

Life in that betrayal, still in doubts on my own accord
from my volition it's a mission of the cold
make you pay for what you've done, rotten to the core of my own perdition
now i'm tying the knot 

making right for what was wrong

[killlxv]
You would
Stab my back
Deception
Is all you've known

Taking 
All i had
Intentions
Were unknown
