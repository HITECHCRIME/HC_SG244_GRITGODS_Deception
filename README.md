## Lyrics

```
[killlxv]

I don't know you
Anymore you're
Just a scar
All i have is pain
You see me fall apart

You would
Stab my back
Deception
Is all you've known

Taking 
All i had
Intentions
Were unknown

Life is betraying me

All those who were close, i thought they cared but that was just me

You would
Stab my back

Is all you've known

Taking 
All i had
Intentions
Were unknown
